## About Lambda C ink

This library is meant to be a helper library to do C console apps. All the functions and types (if any) start with "ldaCink_", all the preprocessor macros start with "LDACINK_".

### ANSI ESCAPE CODES

This library includes some of the ANSI Escape Codes (but not all of them), to access those functions you need to type first "ldaCink_AEC_" and the function or macro or type you want.
